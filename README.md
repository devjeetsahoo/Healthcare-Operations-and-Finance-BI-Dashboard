## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Data Architecture

This project was built using a combination of powerful data tools:

* **Backend & Data Storage:**
    * **SQL:** Used for robust data storage, management, and querying of transactional data like patient records, appointments, and billing.
    * **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for supplementary data, master lists (e.g., doctor specializations, medicine prices), and potentially for initial data staging.

* **Business Intelligence & Visualization:**
    * **Microsoft Power BI:** The core tool for creating the interactive and visually rich dashboard. It connects to the SQL database and Excel files to model and visualize the data.

### Data Workflow

The data flows from its source to the final visualization in a structured manner:

1.  **Data Source:** Raw data is maintained in an **SQL Database** and supplemented with data from **Excel** files.
2.  **Data Modeling & Transformation:** **Power Query** within Power BI is used to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data. This step involves cleaning data, establishing relationships between tables (e.g., Patients, Doctors, Appointments), and creating calculated columns and measures using **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions).
3.  **Data Visualization:** The processed data is then visualized in **Power BI Desktop**, where the various charts, tables, and KPI cards are designed to create the final interactive dashboard.
